# University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Hackathon (April 13 2024)

# Your New Job

Congratulations! You have been hired as a data scientist at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States of America. You will be part of the newly established data science department. The government has collected data on covid related cases, deaths starting from January 2020. Your supervisor would like to better understand the number of cases and deaths to predict when to start the lockdown phase. This study is going to be crucial in preventing such a kind of pandemic in future. You and your team will put your data analysis skills to the test by uncovering insights about the pandemic.


# Resources

* Dataset : [New York Times Data on Github](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

# Milestones
* Download the dataset and process it mentioning any problematic entries.
* Build and validate your models.
* Use your model to answer questions. Some example questions(but not limited to) could be:
    * When is the next lockdown going to be?
    * What did we learn from this pandemic
    * Predict the number of cases/deaths in the next 10 days given the future pandemic follows the same trend as the NYT dataset.
    * Come up with a visualization to present to your supervisor to assess the lockdown date.
    * How early can your model predict the future cases?
* Explain how you validate your model
* Bonus task : use the county level data to predict a regional lockdown
